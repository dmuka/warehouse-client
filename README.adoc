== Overview

A comprehensive inventory management system built with Vue.js that allows tracking of stock balances, managing receipts and shipments, and maintaining reference data for resources, units, and clients.

== Architecture

=== System Architecture

The application follows a Single-Page Application (SPA) architecture with a clear separation between the frontend and backend. The frontend communicates with the backend API through RESTful endpoints.

=== Key Components

* *Frontend*: Vue 3 with Composition API
* *State Management*: Pinia
* *UI Framework*: PrimeVue
* *API Communication*: Axios
* *Routing*: Vue Router
* *Styling*: SCSS with modular architecture

== Design Patterns

=== Frontend Patterns

* *Component-Based Architecture*: The UI is composed of reusable, isolated components (RefsView, RefEditView, etc.) that encapsulate their own logic and styling.

* *Composition API Pattern*: Using Vue 3's Composition API for better code organization and reuse of logic across components.

* *Store Pattern*: Implementing Pinia stores for centralized state management (balancesStore, receiptsStore, shipmentsStore, etc.).

* *Service Layer Pattern*: API communication is abstracted through service modules (`api-client.ts` and `api/index.ts`).

* *Repository Pattern*: Data access logic is encapsulated within store modules that provide methods for CRUD operations.

* *Reactive Programming*: Using Vue's reactivity system with `ref`, `computed`, and `reactive` for reactive state management.

* *Type-Driven Development*: Utilizing TypeScript interfaces for robust type checking across the application.

=== Application Structure

* *Views*: Page components representing entire screens
* *Components*: Reusable UI components
* *Stores*: Pinia stores for state management
* *Services*: API communication layer
* *Types*: TypeScript interfaces
* *Router*: Navigation and routing configuration
* *Styles*: SCSS modules using mixins and variables

== Installation

=== Prerequisites

Before installing the application, ensure you have the following installed:

* Node.js (v22.13.1)
* Yarn
* Git

=== Environment Setup

==== 1. Installing NVM (Node Version Manager)

1. Download the NVM installer for Windows from the official repository.
2. Run nvm-setup.exe and follow the installation instructions.

==== 2. Installing Node.js version 22.13.1

After installing NVM, install the required Node.js version. Open a command prompt with administrator privileges:

[source,bash]
----
nvm install 22.13.1
nvm list
nvm use 22.13.1
node -v  # Should display v22.13.1
----

==== 3. Installing Yarn

Install Yarn using npm:

[source,bash]
----
npm install -g yarn
yarn -v  # Verify the installation
----

==== 4. Setting up the project

1. Clone the repository:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
----

2. Create environment variables file:
+
[source,bash]
----
cp .env.example .env
----
+
Edit the `.env` file to configure your backend API URL:
+
[source,properties]
----
VITE_API_URL=https://localhost:7078/api
----

==== 5. Running the Vue 3 project

1. Create a project folder and open Visual Studio Code in this folder.
2. Run `yarn install` (if you encounter an error, try `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass` first).
3. Start the project with `yarn dev` and open it using the link provided in the console.

=== Production Build

To create a production build:

[source,bash]
----
yarn build
----

=== Backend Setup

This application requires a backend API service that provides endpoints for:

* Balance management
* Receipt operations
* Shipment operations
* Reference data (resources, units, clients)

Ensure your backend implements the required API endpoints matching the frontend's expected data structures.

== Key Dependencies

=== Core Dependencies

* *Vue 3*: Progressive JavaScript framework
* *Pinia*: State management library
* *Vue Router*: Official router for Vue.js
* *TypeScript*: JavaScript with syntax for types
* *Axios*: Promise-based HTTP client

=== UI Components

* *PrimeVue*: UI component library
* *PrimeIcons*: Icon set for PrimeVue

[source,json]
----
"dependencies": {
  "vue": "^3.x",
  "pinia": "^2.x",
  "vue-router": "^4.x",
  "axios": "^1.x",
  "primevue": "^3.x",
  "primeicons": "^6.x"
}
----

== Application Features

=== Stock Management

* View current stock balances with filtering capabilities
* Process receipts (incoming inventory)
* Process shipments (outgoing inventory)

=== Reference Data Management

* Maintain resources catalog
* Manage measurement units
* Track clients

=== User Interface

* Responsive layout with sidebar navigation
* Data tables with sorting and filtering
* Form validation
* Toast notifications

== Configuration

The application can be configured through environment variables:

* `VITE_API_URL`: Backend API URL

== Troubleshooting

=== Common Issues

* *API Connection Issues*: Check that the VITE_API_URL is correctly set in your .env file
* *Build Errors*: Ensure all dependencies are installed with `yarn install`
* *Type Errors*: Make sure TypeScript interfaces match the API response structure
* *PowerShell Execution Policy*: If you encounter errors running scripts, try `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass`
